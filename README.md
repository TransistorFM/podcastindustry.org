# How big is the global podcast market?

## Purpose of this report

The primary reason we're building this estimate is to provide transparency to industry participants. Having an accurate sense of how big the podcast industry is (and how fast it's growing) can help us make strategic decisions. Overestimating the size of the industry could lead to:

- Misallocation of resources: Companies might overinvest in podcasting based on inflated market expectations, leading to inefficient use of capital. Spotify experienced this when they overinvested in 2021.[^1]
- Increased competition and market saturation: An overestimated market might attract more competitors than the actual market can sustain, potentially leading to a "race to the bottom" in pricing and unsustainable business models.
- Financial risks and investor disappointment: Overestimation can lead to inflated valuations and unrealistic revenue forecasts, potentially resulting in financial strain, layoffs, and disappointed investors when actual results don't meet expectations.

## Introduction

Currently, there are two public numbers that are often cited to describe the overall value of the podcasting industry: 

1. [A figure from the IAB](https://www.iab.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/IAB_US_Podcast_Advertising_Revenue_Study_FY2023_May_2024.pdf) shows that annual podcast advertising revenue in the USA was nearly $2 billion in 2023.
2. The second number is from [Grandview Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/podcast-market#:~:text=How%20big%20is%20the%20podcasting,USD%2023.75%20billion%20in%202023.), who estimates the entire podcast market, including all segments, to be $20 billion a year.

Unfortunately, neither the IAB nor Grandview Research have shared a meticulous description of their methodology or sources, which makes it difficult to verify or substantiate their estimates.

Here, we've collected annual returns, financial statements, and other public information. Using this data, we estimate the size of each sub-category within the podcast industry. 

We will contiunally update and publish findings here, and have this page function as a sort of collaborative wiki that anyone can contribute to.

[This page is hosted on a public GitHub repo](https://github.com/TransistorFM/podcastindustry.org/); anyone can issue a pull request with sources and rationale. 

My hope is that the contributions and discussion about these numbers here would lead to an accurate estimate of the podcast industry's size.

Categories that still need to be estimated:
- Podcast Consulting and Education
- Podcast Network Revenues (beyond advertising)

Each category's estimate is explained in detail in the sections below.

It's important to note that the podcast industry is rapidly evolving, and these figures may change quickly. Additionally, there may be some overlap between categories, and the global nature of the industry makes precise estimation challenging.

## Breakdown by Category

### 1. Podcast Advertising

**Estimated annual revenue: $2.9 - $3.2 billion**

Sources:
- IAB U.S. Podcast Advertising Revenue Study (2023): $1.9 billion in U.S. podcast ad revenue[^2]
- IAB Australia Podcast Advertising Market Report (2023)[^3]
- WARC Global Advertising Trends Report (2023)[^4]
- Oberlo Digital Ad Spend by Country Report (2023)[^5]

Rationale:
The IAB study provides a concrete figure for the U.S. market at $1.9 billion. To estimate the global market, we analyzed data from multiple sources (above).

Based on this data, we estimate that the U.S. represents approximately 60-65% of the global podcast advertising market. This estimate is based on these findings:

a) The U.S. market's advanced podcast monetization compared to other countries.
b) The relative size of the U.S. digital ad market compared to other major markets.
c) The dominance of U.S.-based podcast platforms and networks globally.

Calculating from the U.S. revenue of $1.9 billion:

- If U.S. is 65% of global: $1.9 billion / 0.65 = $2.92 billion global
- If U.S. is 60% of global: $1.9 billion / 0.60 = $3.17 billion global

This results in our estimated range of $2.9 - $3.2 billion for global podcast advertising revenue.

It's important to note that this estimate is based on available data primarily from English-speaking countries and major digital advertising markets. The actual figure could be higher if we had more comprehensive data from non-English speaking markets with growing podcast industries.

### 2. Podcast Hosting

**Estimated annual revenue: $100 - $150 million**

Sources:
- Libsyn financial statements: $32.7 million in hosting revenue (2023)[^6]
- Acast financial statements: Approximately $17.3 million in hosting revenue (2023)[^7]
- Market share estimates based on total RSS feeds data, excluding free hosting platforms[^8]
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^9]

Rationale:
We start with known revenue from two major players: Libsyn ($32.7M) and Acast ($17.3M). 

For Acast, the $17.3M figure is an estimate based on their financial statements. Acast reported that approximately 11% of their net sales are generated by non-ad revenue streams, which includes hosting, SaaS products, and other services. With total net sales of 1,636.4 million SEK in 2023, 11% equates to about 180 million SEK or $17.3 million USD.[^10] This figure likely overestimates pure hosting revenue, as it includes other non-ad services.

Using the RSS feed data, but excluding free hosting platforms (Anchor/Spotify for Podcasters, Soundcloud, and Feedburner), we can recalculate market shares:

- Total paid hosting feeds: 1,034,606
- Libsyn: 100,043 feeds (9.67% of paid market)
- Acast: 40,119 feeds (3.88% of paid market)

Extrapolating from Libsyn's revenue and market share suggests a total market of $338M ($32.7M / 9.67%). Using Acast's figures suggests $446M ($17.3M / 3.88%). However, these extrapolations assume similar revenue per podcast across all hosts, which is likely not accurate. The Acast figure, in particular, may lead to an overestimate as it includes non-hosting revenues.

From the Reddit threads, we see hosting costs ranging from $0 (using free platforms) to about $20/month for paid services. Let's assume an average of $10/month for podcasters who pay for hosting.

Using our estimate of 1,034,606 paid hosting feeds, and assuming 80% of these are actively paying (some may be on free trials or inactive):

827,684 * $10 * 12 months = $99,322,080

Considering that:
1. Larger hosts may have economies of scale
2. Many podcasts generate little to no revenue
3. There's a wide range of pricing among hosts
4. Our Acast estimate may include non-hosting revenues

We conservatively estimate the paid podcast hosting market to be between $100 million and $150 million annually. This range accounts for the known data while acknowledging the limitations of our extrapolation method and the potential overestimate from Acast's figures.

### 3. Podcasting Equipment

**Estimated annual revenue: $285 - $300 million**

Sources:
- Audio-Technica annual statement (2023)[^11]
- Sennheiser Group press release (2023)[^12]
- Logitech SEC filing regarding Blue Microphones acquisition (2018)[^13]

Rationale:
This estimate is based on financial data from major audio equipment manufacturers, with assumptions about what percentage of their sales are related to podcasting. We estimated Sennheiser's podcasting revenue at $85.2 million (15% of total), Blue Microphones at $47.6 million (40% of total, adjusted for growth since 2018), and Audio-Technica at $2.6 million (10% of microphone sales). Assuming these companies represent 45-50% of the market, we arrive at a total market estimate of $285-300 million.

### 4. Direct Listener Support

**Estimated annual revenue: $350 million**

Sources:
- Patreon press release: "Podcasters earned over $350 million from their real fans on Patreon last year" (2023)[^14]

Rationale:
This figure comes directly from Patreon's press release. While there are other platforms for direct listener support (like Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, etc.), Patreon is the dominant player in this space for podcasters. The $350 million likely represents a significant majority of direct listener support for podcasters.

### 5. Podcast Production Services

**Estimated annual revenue: $120 - $180 million**

Sources:
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^9]
- Extrapolation based on the number of active podcasts[^8]

Rationale:
Many podcasters mentioned hiring editors or production teams in the Reddit threads. Costs varied widely, but we assumed an average of $100 per episode for those who outsource. Assuming 10% of active podcasts (103,460) use these services monthly:

103,460 * $100 * 12 months = $124,152,000

We've provided a range to account for potential variations in usage and pricing.

### 6. Podcast Recording and Editing Software

**Estimated annual revenue: $100 - $150 million**

Sources:
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^9]
- Extrapolation based on the number of active podcasts[^8]

Rationale:
Many podcasters mentioned using software like Descript, Riverside.fm, Squadcast, GarageBand, and Adobe Audition. We estimated that about 30% of active podcasters use paid software, with an average monthly cost of $25:

310,381 * $25 * 12 months = $93,114,300

We've provided a range to account for free software users and potential variations in pricing and usage.

### 7. Podcast Analytics and Measurement Tools

**Estimated annual revenue: $50 - $75 million**

Sources:
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^9]
- Extrapolation based on the number of paid hosting users[^8]

Rationale:
Several podcasters mentioned using analytics tools. We assumed 20% of paid hosting users subscribe to such services at an average of $20/month:

206,921 * $20 * 12 months = $49,661,040

The range accounts for potential variations in usage and pricing.

### 8. Podcast Transcription Services

**Estimated annual revenue: $15 - $25 million**

Sources:
- Reddit thread discussions on podcast expenses[^9]
- Extrapolation based on the number of paid hosting users[^8]

Rationale:
Some podcasters mentioned using transcription services. We assumed 15% of paid hosting users use these services at an average of $10 per episode, monthly:

155,190 * $10 * 12 months = $18,622,800

The range accounts for potential variations in usage and pricing.

### 9. Podcast Consulting and Education

Estimated annual revenue: To be determined

Sources: [To be added]

Rationale: This category would include revenue from podcast consultants, online courses, workshops, and educational resources about podcasting.

### 10. Podcast Events and Conferences

**Estimated annual revenue: $15 - $20 million**

Sources:
- Podcast Movement website[^15]
- The Podcast Show London website[^16]
- PodFest sponsor deck[^17]

Rationale:
This estimate is based on data from major podcast conferences and an estimation of smaller events worldwide:

1. Major conferences:
   - Podcast Movement (2 events): ~$3 - $3.5 million annually
   - The Podcast Show London: ~$950,000 - $1.2 million
   - PodFest: ~$700,000 - $900,000

2. Other conferences and events:
   Estimated 20-30 additional events generating an average of $250,000 - $350,000 each.
   Estimated total for smaller events: $5 - $10.5 million

The estimate includes ticket sales and sponsorship revenues. For major events, we calculated based on reported attendance figures and estimated average ticket prices. Sponsorship revenues were estimated based on publicly available sponsorship packages.

This estimate is likely conservative as it may not fully account for:
- Associated revenue streams (workshops, merchandise, etc.)
- Rapid growth in the podcast event industry
- Potential underreporting of attendee numbers or ticket prices

### 11. Podcast Network Revenues (beyond advertising)

Estimated annual revenue: To be determined

Sources: [To be added]

Rationale: This category would cover revenues generated by podcast networks through means other than advertising, such as content licensing, merchandise, or other monetization strategies.

## Methodology and Limitations

This estimate is based on publicly available financial data, industry reports, and reasonable assumptions where specific data is not available. The actual global podcast industry revenue may differ due to:

1. Limited financial data from private companies
2. Rapid changes in the industry
3. Varying definitions of what constitutes podcast-related revenue
4. Potential overlap between categories (e.g., some hosting providers also offer advertising services)

Further research and data collection could help refine this estimate.

## Final notes

The goal here, whenever possible, is to avoid sourcing generalized estimates from other sites (like Statistica, Latka, CB Insights, LeadIQ, etc) that don't share their methodology.

[^10]: In the Annual Report for 2023, on page 20 under "Net sales breakdown", there's a note that says: "Acast's net sales are mainly generated from advertising revenue recognized over time. Just over 11% of Acast net sales are generated by non-ad revenue streams, such as SaaS and subscription revenue, for the reporting periods presented." Given that Acast's total net sales for 2023 was 1,636.4 million SEK (as stated multiple times in the report), we can calculate: 11% of 1,636.4 million SEK = 179.9 million SEK. Converting to USD at an approximate exchange rate of 0.096 SEK to USD: 179.9 million SEK * 0.096 = $17.27 million USD
