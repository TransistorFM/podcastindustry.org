## Survey overview and data

From February 5 to March 5, 2025, I surveyed "Gen Z podcast fans."

- [Survey form](https://forms.reform.app/pF4xrZ/podcast-survey-2025/d9906d)
- [Survey results data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jl_Y7c_G1UMRcXHwzH5jxgQPIzFcSY8bnLP3Nn8aCQE/edit?usp=sharing) (Google Sheets)
- [Download raw survey results](https://podcastindustry.org/2025-gen-z-survey/Gen%20Z%20podcast%20fan%20survey%20-%20podcast-survey-2025-responses.csv) (CSV)

## How many responses did you get?

In total, we had 102 legitimate respondents, aged 13-29.

This might seem like a small sample, but it's in line with much larger studies done by big firms:

- Edison Research's [2024 Infinite Dial survey](https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2024/) had a total sample of 1,086 people (aged 12-100). It's possible they only had a few hundred respondents in the 13-29 age range.
- When the [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/articles/gen-z-podcasts-influencers-polling) did their survey in 2020, they were only able to get 320 Gen Z respondents.

The point being: Gen Z is a difficult generation to reach, even by larger research firms. A full-scale research study incorporating surveys by one of these firms can cost between $20,000-$100,000 depending on the scope.

All of that said, I would like to commission a bigger study of Gen Z podcast consumers in the future to test my initial results.

## How does these results compare with other studies?

Our study mirrors findings in separate studies from [Morning Consult](https://pro.morningconsult.com/articles/gen-z-podcasts-influencers-polling) (as mentioned above) and "Online Audio Brand Used Most Often in [Edison Research’s 2024 Infinite Dial](https://www.edisonresearch.com/the-infinite-dial-2024/):

Amongst those aged 12-34, the "audio brand used the most often:"
- 55% used Spotify
- 14% used YouTube Music
- 17% used Apple Music

Interestingly, Edison Research's [2023 Gen Z Podcast Listener](https://www.edisonresearch.com/solutions/gen-z-podcast-listener-report/) report doesn't include data on which podcast app Gen Z prefers. However, they did find that 77% of respondents aged 13-24 had listened to an audio podcast.

## How the survey was distributed

The survey was primarily distributed via these channels:

- The [/r/genZ sub-reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1iiq5kg/any_podcast_fans_here/) (with moderator approval)
- Reddit ads targeting Gen Z users
- Tumblr ads targeting users aged 13-28
- Through newsletters, social media
